Dancing links java implementation
----------------------------
Implements Knuth's [Algorithm X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_X) a recursive backtracking approach for solving [exact cover problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) such as Sudoku and pentomino. Knuth's dancing links (DLX) implementation employs a clever way of juggling pointers in a circular doubly linked lists to represent the exact cover matrix.
